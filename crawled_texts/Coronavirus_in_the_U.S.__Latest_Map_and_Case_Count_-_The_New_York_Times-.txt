See our . maps tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world Case numbers remain persistently high across much of the country, though reports of new cases have dropped considerably since late July, when the country averaged well over 60,000 per day. But as many of the country’s most populous states saw vast improvement, and as the Northeast kept case reports low, new infections were rising by late summer across parts of the Midwest and South. Deaths, though still well below their peak spring levels, averaged around 850 per day in early September, far more than were reported in early July.

Deaths tend to rise a few weeks after a rise in infections, as there is typically a delay between when people are infected, when they die and when deaths are reported. Some deaths reported in the last two weeks may have occurred much earlier because of these delays. A year that started out normal — with packed sports arenas, busy airports and handshake-heavy political campaigning — quickly became defined by the pandemic. In late February, there were just a few dozen known cases in the United States, most of them linked to travel. But by summer, the virus had torn through every state, infecting more people than the combined populations of Louisiana and Wyoming. The national death toll exceeded 185,000, more than the population of Providence, R.I. And after glimmers of progress in the late spring, cases surged to new records in July.

Concerts, parades and high school football games continue to be called off. Countless people have found themselves jobless and struggling to afford housing.

The numbers in this article are being updated several times a day based on the latest information our journalists are gathering from around the country. The Times has in hopes of helping researchers and policymakers as they seek to slow the pandemic and prevent future ones. made that data public The Times’s data collection for this page is based on reports from state and local health agencies, a process that is unchanged by that hospitals bypass the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and send all patient information to a central database in Washington. the Trump administration's requirement The places hit hardest The coronavirus has left no state unscathed. But its impact has been wildly uneven. Officials in California, Florida and Texas, the states with the most known cases, have each identified more than 600,000 cases. In a few less populous states, including Vermont and Wyoming, there are fewer than 5,000 patients. And in a handful of remote counties, there has been not even one positive test. The nation’s most populous places have all suffered tremendously. In Cook County, Ill., which includes Chicago, more than 5,000 people have died. In Los Angeles County, Calif., at least 246,000 people have had the virus, more than in most states. And in New York City, about one of every 360 residents has died. But unlike in the early days of the pandemic, it is not so simple to say that big cities have been hit hardest. On a per capita basis, many of the places with the most cases have been small and mid-sized metros in the Southwest with large Native American or Hispanic populations. In Yuma County, Ariz., along the country’s border with Mexico, about one of every 17 residents is known to have had the virus. In McKinley County, N.M., which includes part of the hard-hit Navajo Nation, one of every 300 residents has died from Covid-19.

Hundreds of thousands of cases traced to clusters Coronavirus outbreaks have been traced to funerals, fast food restaurants, cruise ships and Navy vessels. But most of the biggest known clusters have been in nursing homes, food processing plants and correctional facilities, all places where people are packed in close quarters with little opportunity for social distancing. Read more here about some of the country’s less-noticed coronavirus clusters. Coronavirus cases have been reported in more than 18,000 nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, according to from states, counties, the federal government and facilities themselves. More than 439,000 residents and employees have been infected in those homes, and more than 72,000 have died. That means more than 35 percent of deaths from the virus in the United States have been tied to nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. data collected by The New York Times We’re tracking the devastating effects of the coronavirus in more than 16,000 nursing homes across the country » “This disease creates the potential for a perfect storm in a long-term care facility — large groups of vulnerable people living together and a highly transmissible virus that may not cause symptoms in those who care for them,” said Dr. Daniel Rusyniak, the chief medical officer for Indiana’s state social services agency. In American jails and prisons, more than 186,000 people have been infected and at least 1,120 inmates and correctional officers have died. During interviews with dozens of inmates across the country, many said they were frightened and frustrated by what prison officials have acknowledged has been an uneven response to the virus. “I am very concerned,” said Adamu Chan, an inmate at San Quentin State Prison in California, which has become one of the nation’s largest coronavirus clusters with more than 2,500 infections and 27 deaths. “There’s no way to social distance. We all eat together. We have a communal bathroom. There’s no way to address a public health issue in an overcrowded facility.” Since March, The Times has sought information on clusters from state and county officials, as well as companies and facility operators. Of the thousands clusters confirmed by reporters, The Times is publishing a list of groupings of 50 more cases linked to a specific site, workplace or event.

Most governments update their data on a daily basis, and report cases and deaths based on an individual’s residence. Not all governments report these the same way. The Times uses the total of confirmed and probable counts when they are available individually or combined. To see whether a state includes probable cases and deaths, visit the individual state pages listed at the bottom of this page. The Times has identified the following reporting anomalies or methodology changes in the data: New Jersey began reporting probable deaths. June 25: New York City released deaths from earlier periods but did not specify when they were from. June 30: Texas began reporting deaths based on death certificates, causing a one-day increase. July 27: To see a detailed list of all reporting anomalies, visit the individual state pages listed at the bottom of this page. The U.S. data includes cases and deaths that have been identified by public health officials as confirmed coronavirus patients, and also includes probable coronavirus cases and deaths when governments report them. , which are widely considered to be an undercount of the true toll, are counts of individuals whose coronavirus infections were confirmed by a molecular laboratory test. count individuals who meet criteria for other types of testing, symptoms and exposure, as developed by national and local governments. Confirmed cases and deaths Probable cases and deaths Governments often revise data or report a single-day large increase in cases or deaths from unspecified days without historical revisions, which can cause an irregular pattern in the daily reported figures. The Times is excluding these anomalies from seven-day averages when possible.

It seems that there are : how close you get to an infected person; how long you are near that person; whether that person expels viral droplets on or near you; and how much you touch your face afterwards. understanding of how the Covid-19 works is growing four factors that most likely play a role Here is a guide to the symptoms of Covid-19. You can help reduce your risk and do your part to protect others by following some : basic steps Keep your distance from others. Stay at least six feet away from people outside your household as much as possible. Wear a mask outside your home. A mask protects others from your germs, and it protects you from infection as well. The more people who wear masks, the more we all stay safer. Wash your hands often. Anytime you come in contact with a surface outside your home, scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds, rinse and then dry your hands with a clean towel. Avoid touching your face. The virus can spread when our hands come into contact with the virus, and we touch our nose, mouth or eyes. Try to keep your hands away from your face unless you have just recently washed them.
