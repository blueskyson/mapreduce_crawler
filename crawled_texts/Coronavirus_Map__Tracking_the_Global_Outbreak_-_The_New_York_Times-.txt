Deaths tend to rise a few weeks after a rise in infections, as there is typically a delay between when people are infected, when they die and when deaths are reported. Some deaths reported in the last two weeks may have occurred much earlier because of these delays. The outbreak was initially defined by a series of shifting epicenters — including Wuhan, China; Iran; northern Italy; Spain; and New York. Cases worldwide leveled off in April after social distancing measures were put in place in many of the areas with early outbreaks. But as countries began to reopen in May and June, the United States was unable to contain a resurgence of the disease, making it one of the main drivers of rising case numbers around the world. Many South American countries are also experiencing high rates of infection, with Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Argentina reporting large numbers of cases every day.
