Reminisce with intention because at some point in the future, you will have one again. Opinion Guisado on Sunset By Terence Nance Have you ever wanted to find a missed connection? That’s what HBO’s “Random Acts of Flyness” creator Terence Nance tries to do in his latest film, “Guisado on Sunset,” which premiered at this year’s Sundance Film Festival.
